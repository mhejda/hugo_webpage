So, there is a challenge I designated for myself somewhere halfway through the first year of my PhD here on Glasgow: to climb fifty Munros (hills in Scotland with a height over 3,000 feet). There is currently 282 of those peaks, and just a few days ago, a new record was set for the fastest continuous round including all of those. Donnie Campbell managed to complete all of them just under 32 days - which would be a crazy achievement on its own - while also only using his own energy (self-propelling) to get from one hill to the other (think bikes and kayaks). Well. my goals are a wee bit more modest here. Doing around 25 per year on average leaves the freedom to cherrypick only weekends with very good weather, and take things more easy in general. Everything looked well and promising after doing Beinn Chabhair (#4) in the beginning of this year.

But then, the 'rona hit and flipped everything on its head.

Local lockdowns in the UK.

And me, actually moving back home to Czechia for over four months due to having no access to my lab.

What was supposed to be a first, strong year of Munro bagging turned to be year 2020, where we always expect a new disaster to hit every morning.

I moved back to Scotland in the middle of August, and the goal was clear: seize the long, warm summer days and get the Munro bagging game going! Luckily, my flatmate Gergely shares the lust for Munro bagging, and we went for all of Augusts walks together.

**In total, I bagged 9 Munros during second half of August, raising the total number to 14.**

## Munros #5 & #6: Ben More and Stob Binnein

#### 15/8/2020  
Starting point: Crianlarich Station  
Time: approx. 8h20m  
Total ascent: 1469 m

I arrived to Glasgow on Thursday, and we immediately decided that Saturdays good weather has to be seized for a hillwalk. Juan, a new member of my research group, has agreed to join us for his first ever Munro adventure. Together, we headed by train from Glasgow Queen St to Crianlarich. As we approached our final destination, I started wondering about the thick layer of grey clouds sitting low, hiding the tops of surrounding hills. "Could there be a chance that we manage to actually go higher than the clouds?" From Crianlarich, we followed the main road east towards the Ben More farm. The walk officially started there, first with a tarmac road.

The ascend was tough, and we quickly ascended to cloud level, where we got lost in the cloud fog. Small frozen dropplets were hitting our faces (which was honestly surprisingly pleasant) and as we slowly fumbled upwards, the clouds started clearing out and sunshine got stronger and stronger. All of a sudden, we reached a level above the cloud, and were rewared with an incredible view of a cloud inversion.

After a while of further uphill walking in glorious, warm sunny morning, we reached the peak of Ben More, with absolutely magnificient views in all directions.

A fairly straightforward walk - we just needed to descend down to the Bealach Eadar da-Bheinn, lose over 300m of precious altitude and then reascend the second peak to basically the same altitude as the first one. On our descend, we again passed through the cloud layer and back on the second ascend to the peak of Stob Binnein. Both of the mountains have very similar "cone-like" character, and the ascend is straightforward, although again quite steep. After a brief break on the second peak, we retraced our steps down to the bealach, and began the descend to the west by the steep grassy hill along the stream, as recommended on the WalkingHighlangs route page. Later on, we bumped into a couple that told us that the path which is NOT recommended on WH is actually not boggy, and hence sounded like a much better choice than ours. After a while, the faint descend boggy path reached the glen, through which we returned back to the starting point. As a last thing, we had to retrace our steps back to Crianlarich, which proved to be quite tiring with over 1300m of elevation in our feet. Luckily, we managed to return with some extra time before the train departure, and managed to squeeze in a cold, socially distanced pint at Rod & Reel pub. Overall, a really rewarding day in the hills!
