      <description>There&#39;s couple of things that Glasgow is renowned for. Some of them are positive: it serves as the gateway to the Highlands, has a vibrant, thriving music scene and Glaswegians in general are very friendly people&amp;hellip; oh, and apparently also is the the birthplace of tikka masala. On the other hand, it also has quite a reputation for being rough and dangerous, but from my own personal experience, that&#39;s almost completely rooted in the past, and today&#39;s Glasgow is definitely as safe as any other big city in Europe (perhaps except for few areas further from the centre).</description>

      <description>Welcome to a very first post on this blog! This was posted on the symbolic day of 02/02/2020 - you can&#39;t represent the date using only two numerals very often, and as such, this felt like a perfect starting date for the webpage!
Munro Bagging log, #4: Beinn Chabhair (from Inverarnan) This was the very first Munro-targeting hillwalk of 2020 and the first walk we went for together with my flatmate Gergely.</description>
