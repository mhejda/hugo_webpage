      <description>Welcome to a very first post on this blog! This was posted on the symbolic day of 02/02/2020 - you can&#39;t represent the date using only two numerals very often, and as such, this felt like a perfect starting date for the webpage!
Munro Bagging log, #4: Beinn Chabhair (from Inverarnan) This was the very first Munro-targeting hillwalk of 2020 and the first walk we went for together with my flatmate Gergely.</description>
